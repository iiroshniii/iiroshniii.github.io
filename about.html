        <p>Hi! I am Roshni Maniraj. I am a tech girlie working a software developer at Ericsson AB.
            That's how I would introduce myself professionally. There is more to me than that.. 
            I love to read, I love art-painting, drawing and crafts-making and building things. I 
            love dogs and sunflowers and coffee.
            There are more pages I might add here... where I share some of these hobbies. (MAYBE?)
        </p>
        <p>
            I am from Bangalore, India and now based off of Stockholm, Sweden.
        </p>
